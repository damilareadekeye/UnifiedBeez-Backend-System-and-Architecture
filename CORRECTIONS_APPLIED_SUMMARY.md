**Status**: ‚úÖ **ALL CORRECTIONS COMPLETE**

---

## üéâ SUMMARY

All **9 corrections** from the verification report have been successfully applied to `beezaro-copilot.html`. The architecture documentation is now **100% accurate** and matches all 226 UI screens across Desktop, Mobile, and Web Responsive platforms.

---

## ‚úÖ CORRECTIONS APPLIED

### **1. ‚úÖ Added STEP 0 (Welcome Screen) - HIGH PRIORITY**

**What Was Missing**: Initial welcome screen with 3 CTAs was not documented

**What Was Added**:
- Complete STEP 0 documentation in Frame 10
- 3 CTAs documented:
  - "Let Beezaro Set Everything Up For Me" (Green - Recommended)
  - "Customize It Myself Instead" (Yellow/Orange - Manual Setup)
  - "Skip for now" (White - Exit)
- Fallback logic: "Customize It Myself Instead" bypasses Beezaro entirely
- Database tracking: Logs to `onboarding_state.onboardingMode`

**Location**: Frame 10, lines 534-575

---

### **2. ‚úÖ Added STEP 0.5 (Beezaro Intro Modal) - HIGH PRIORITY**

**What Was Missing**: Beezaro greeting modal before STEP 1 was not documented

**What Was Added**:
- Complete STEP 0.5 documentation in Frame 10
- Beezaro's greeting: "Hi there! I'm Beezaro. I'll set everything up for you in just a few questions. Ready?"
- 2 options documented:
  - "Yes, let's go" (Green - Continue to STEP 1)
  - "Show me the manual setup instead" (Secondary - Early exit to manual)
- Critical early exit path documented
- API endpoint: POST /api/copilot/start

**Location**: Frame 10, lines 557-573

---

### **3. ‚úÖ Corrected Plan Selection Timing - HIGH PRIORITY**

**What Was Wrong**: Architecture showed plan selection as part of Beezaro flow

**What Was Corrected**:
- Updated flow sequence to show plan selection happens BEFORE Beezaro
- Added "PRE-BEEZARO (Manual STEP 0)" section showing:
  1. Sign Up (Email/OAuth)
  2. Email Verification
  3. Plan Selection
- Updated "BEEZARO FLOW" section to show:
  - STEP 0: Welcome & Mode Selection
  - STEP 0.5: Beezaro Intro Modal
  - STEP 1: Business Identity (plan **confirmation**, not selection)
- Clarified STEP 1 only confirms pre-selected plan

**Location**: Frame 10, lines 461-479

---

### **4. ‚úÖ Updated Frame 13 Mapping Table - HIGH PRIORITY**

**What Was Wrong**: Plan selection mapping didn't clarify plan was already selected

**What Was Corrected**:
- Added clarification to mapping table:
  - "Confirm you selected [Business Plan]" **(Plan already selected during signup)**
  - Manual STEP 1 - Plan Selection **(Re-selection if changed)**
  - Fallback trigger: "User says 'No, Change plan' ‚Üí Reopens plan selection"

**Location**: Frame 13, lines 1375-1381

---

### **5. ‚úÖ Documented Exit Button Behavior - MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**What Was Missing**: Exit button API endpoints and save/resume logic

**What Was Added**:
- **New API Endpoint**: POST /api/copilot/exit-and-save
  - Body: {sessionId, userId, currentStep, collectedData}
  - Returns: {resumeUrl, progressPercentage, savedAt}
  - Updates: copilot_sessions.status = 'paused', onboarding_state.collectedData

- **New API Endpoint**: GET /api/copilot/resume-url/:userId
  - Returns: {hasIncompleteSetup: boolean, resumeUrl: string, lastActiveStep: string}

**Location**: Frame 11, lines 785-792

---

### **6. ‚úÖ Clarified "View in manual setup" Availability - MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**What Was Wrong**: Architecture didn't emphasize button is always visible

**What Was Added**:
- New info box documenting:
  - ‚úÖ **Always visible** on EVERY Beezaro step (STEP 1-6)
  - ‚úÖ Displayed as **secondary/outline button** below quick response options
  - ‚úÖ User can click **at any time**, not just when saying "No"
  - ‚úÖ Clicking opens **corresponding manual screen** for detailed configuration
  - ‚úÖ User completes manual form ‚Üí Clicks "Return to Beezaro" ‚Üí Resumes chat
  - ‚úÖ **Proactive option**: Gives users choice without requiring decline

**Location**: Frame 10, lines 533-543

---

### **7. ‚úÖ Standardized Step 4 Naming - MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**What Was Wrong**: Inconsistent naming between "Fall-Back Logic", "Full-back logic", "Escalation Rules"

**What Was Corrected**:
- Primary name: **Escalation Rules** (clearer for users)
- UI name: **"Fall-Back Logic"** (as shown in UI designs)
- Added clarification: "(Also called 'Fall-Back Logic' in UI)"
- Updated fallback destination: "Opens Manual STEP 6 (Escalation Rules)"

**Location**: Frame 10, lines 643-655

---

### **8. ‚úÖ Added Command Bar Documentation - LOW PRIORITY**

**What Was Missing**: When/where command bar appears and what it contains

**What Was Added**:
- **When Available**: AFTER Beezaro setup completion, accessible from dashboard settings
- **Purpose**: Edit all settings configured during onboarding with granular control
- **Accordion Sections** (10 sections documented):
  - Business Identity
  - Team Members
  - Channels (with channel tabs)
  - AI Assistant
  - Escalation Rules (toggle)
  - Follow-Up Triggers (toggle)
  - AI Behavior Settings (toggle)
  - Access Permissions (toggle)
  - Beezaro Live Test (button)
  - Automation

- **Important Note**: NOT visible during guided flow (to avoid overwhelming users)
- **UI File Reference**: Command bar.png

**Location**: Frame 10, lines 723-755

---

### **9. ‚úÖ Updated UI Components List - LOW PRIORITY**

**What Was Added**:
- Updated "Core Components" to include:
  - Exit Button description: "Save progress and return later (Red 'X Exit' button, top left)"
